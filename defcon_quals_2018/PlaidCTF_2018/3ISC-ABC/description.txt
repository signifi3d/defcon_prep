Reversing (400 pts)
A spirited reverse engineer should be good at critical reading of programs in all languages, from verilog to C, from b3s23 to lisp. If you have at least a bit of spirit of reversing, then you better show us here before time runs out! 

DISCLAIMER: We will not provide another chance for you to show a "spirit" of reversing if you do not show your awesomeness here within a reasonable amount of time.
