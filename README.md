Distraught with the large gap in necessary knowledge between easy and hard CTFs with not terribly much in between, this project is an attempt to gather as many writeups and assets related to events used as qualifiers for Defcon CTFs over the years for the purposes of study and growth. 

This is a continual work in progress, but at the moment I have started at qualifying events for Defcon 2018's CTF since thats the beginning of easy to find information about qualifying events from Order of the Overflow. After those I'll start moving backwards.

What's available for every competition is going to be very different. I've included any easy to access assets directly in the repository. For some others I've provided links, especially if the assets are very large. For others you can often times find assets through writeups. For anything else we may just be out of luck.
