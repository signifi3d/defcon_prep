Please redownload the challenge; we fixed a packing issue.

Due to corona, I’m in home office and yesterday, I (while not being completely sober) played around with some alarm systems of the clients and … apparently … changed my engineer password since I cannot access anything anymore … my boss has called this morning and threatened to fire me if I don’t fix that ASAP … I have not the slightest idea what my password could be or how I can get it back … can you please help me recover it???!! I have to fix that mess somehow …

I removed the clients’ data to not get into even more trouble …

Before I forget: Download SPC Connect Pro and start it pointing to the folder SPC Products. (The software will ask you which directory it should use)
https://www.spcconnectpro.com/install/setup.exe

Our company login to the software is admin/admin. Luckily, I did not change that …

Oh no … my boss is calling again … we talk later … good luck.
